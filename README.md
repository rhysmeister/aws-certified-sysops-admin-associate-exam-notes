## Domain 1: Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation
### 1.1 Implement metrics, alarms, and filters by using AWS monitoring and logging services

To assist with the knowledge items in this section we will create 3 Amazon Linux 2 Instances in the default VPC with a new ssh key. Methods for doing this will be given with the Web Console, the AWS Command_line and Cloudformation.

#### Web Console
#### AWS Command-Line
#### CloudFormation

* Identify, collect, analyze, and export logs (for example, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch
Logs Insights, AWS CloudTrail logs)
* Collect metrics and logs using the CloudWatch agent
* Create CloudWatch alarms
* Create metric filters
* Create CloudWatch dashboards
* Configure notifications (for example, Amazon Simple Notification Service [Amazon SNS],
Service Quotas, CloudWatch alarms, AWS Health events)
### 1.2 Remediate issues based on monitoring and availability metrics
* Troubleshoot or take corrective actions based on notifications and alarms
* Configure Amazon EventBridge rules to trigger actions
* Use AWS Systems Manager Automation documents to take action based on AWS Config rules
## Domain 2: Reliability and Business Continuity
### 2.1 Implement scalability and elasticity
* Create and maintain AWS Auto Scaling plans
* Implement caching
* Implement Amazon RDS replicas and Amazon Aurora Replicas
* Implement loosely coupled architectures
* Differentiate between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling
### 2.2 Implement high availability and resilient environments
* Configure Elastic Load Balancer and Amazon Route 53 health checks
* Differentiate between the use of a single Availability Zone and Multi-AZ deployments (for
example, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon FSx, Amazon RDS)
* Implement fault-tolerant workloads (for example, Amazon Elastic File System [Amazon EFS],
Elastic IP addresses)
* Implement Route 53 routing policies (for example, failover, weighted, latency based)
### 2.3 Implement backup and restore strategies
* Automate snapshots and backups based on use cases (for example, RDS snapshots, AWS
Backup, RTO and RPO, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, retention policy)
* Restore databases (for example, point-in-time restore, promote read replica)
* Implement versioning and lifecycle rules
* Configure Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication
* Execute disaster recovery procedures
## Domain 3: Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation
### 3.1 Provision and maintain cloud resources
* Create and manage AMIs (for example, EC2 Image Builder)
* Create, manage, and troubleshoot AWS CloudFormation
* Provision resources across multiple AWS Regions and accounts (for example, AWS Resource
Access Manager, CloudFormation StackSets, IAM cross-account roles)
* Select deployment scenarios and services (for example, blue/green, rolling, canary)
* Identify and remediate deployment issues (for example, service quotas, subnet sizing,
* CloudFormation and AWS OpsWorks errors, permissions)
### 3.2 Automate manual or repeatable processes
* Use AWS services (for example, OpsWorks, Systems Manager, CloudFormation) to automate
deployment processes
* Implement automated patch management
* Schedule automated tasks by using AWS services (for example, EventBridge, AWS Config)
## Domain 4: Security and Compliance
### 4.1 Implement and manage security and compliance policies
* Implement IAM features (for example, password policies, MFA, roles, SAML, federated identity,
resource policies, policy conditions)
* Troubleshoot and audit access issues by using AWS services (for example, CloudTrail, IAM
Access Analyzer, IAM policy simulator)
* Validate service control policies and permissions boundaries
* Review AWS Trusted Advisor security checks
* Validate AWS Region and service selections based on compliance requirements
* Implement secure multi-account strategies (for example, AWS Control Tower, AWS
Organizations)
### 4.2 Implement data and infrastructure protection strategies
* Enforce a data classification scheme
* Create, manage, and protect encryption keys
* Implement encryption at rest (for example, AWS Key Management Service [AWS KMS])
* Implement encryption in transit (for example, AWS Certificate Manager, VPN)
* Securely store secrets by using AWS services (for example, AWS Secrets Manager, Systems
Manager Parameter Store)
* Review reports or findings (for example, AWS Security Hub, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Config,
Amazon Inspector) 
## Domain 5: Networking and Content Delivery
### 5.1 Implement networking features and connectivity
* Configure a VPC (for example, subnets, route tables, network ACLs, security groups, NAT
gateway, internet gateway)
* Configure private connectivity (for example, Systems Manager Session Manager, VPC
endpoints, VPC peering, VPN)
* Configure AWS network protection services (for example, AWS WAF, AWS Shield)
### Configure domains, DNS services, and content delivery
* Configure Route 53 hosted zones and records
* Implement Route 53 routing policies (for example, geolocation, geoproximity)
* Configure DNS (for example, Route 53 Resolver)
* Configure Amazon CloudFront and S3 origin access identity (OAI)
* Configure S3 static website hosting
### Troubleshoot network connectivity issues
* Interpret VPC configurations (for example, subnets, route tables, network ACLs, security
groups)
* Collect and interpret logs (for example, VPC Flow Logs, Elastic Load Balancer access logs, AWS
WAF web ACL logs, CloudFront logs)
* Identify and remediate CloudFront caching issues
* Troubleshoot hybrid and private connectivity issues
## Domain 6: Cost and Performance Optimization
### 6.1 Implement cost optimization strategies
* Implement cost allocation tags
* Identify and remediate underutilized or unused resources by using AWS services and tools (for
example, Trusted Advisor, AWS Compute Optimizer, Cost Explorer)
* Configure AWS Budgets and billing alarms
* Assess resource usage patterns to qualify workloads for EC2 Spot Instances
* Identify opportunities to use managed services (for example, Amazon RDS, AWS Fargate, EFS)
### 6.2 Implement performance optimization strategies
* Recommend compute resources based on performance metrics
* Monitor Amazon EBS metrics and modify configuration to increase performance efficiency
* Implement S3 performance features (for example, S3 Transfer Acceleration, multipart uploads)
* Monitor RDS metrics and modify the configuration to increase performance efficiency (for
example, Performance Insights, RDS Proxy)
* Enable enhanced EC2 capabilities (for example, enhanced network adapter, instance store,
placement groups)
